*** CONST ***
  value that can not be changed in the future
  an immutalbe variable, a variable that can not be mutated with later code
  cannot declare 'empty' const variables
  use const when you don't expect the variable to change
  let can introduce bugs by allowing the variable to change to something else
    
*** VAR ***
  old way of defining variables, mostly avoided now
  prior to es6
  let is block scoped
  var is function scoped
